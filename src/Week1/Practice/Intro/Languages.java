        // Procedural
        // - specifies a series of well-structured steps and procedures to compose a program.
        // - contains a systematic order of statements, functions and commands to complete a task.

        // Functional
        // - Writing a program only pure functions i.e. never modify variables but only create new ones as an output.
        // - used in situations where we have to perform lots of different operations on the same set of data, like ML.
        // - First Class functions?

        // Object Oriented
        // Code + Data = Object
        // Develop to make it easier to develop, debug, reuse, and maintain software
    }
